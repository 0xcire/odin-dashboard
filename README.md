# Dashboard - The Odin Project

Didn't like my previous implementation so remaking it.

Something I struggle with is just diving into a project head on.

In remaking this, although simple, I'm seeing the benefits of creating the layout first and not trying to fix things in reverse.

Unfortunately I can't use this efficient model for the todo and weather app since I am recreating this retroactively, but moving forward in this course and for all my future personal projects I am 100% not just diving in head first with no plan anymore.
